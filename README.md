Telescope --> Telescope is a highly extendable fuzzy finder plugin. It allows us to quickly search. preview, and open files, buffers, help tags, git commits, etc.

Buffer in Neovim --> A buffer is an in-memory representation of a file or text. It's where editing happens before you save anything to disk.
